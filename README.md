A basic React form validation code challenge

## Requirements
* do some basic regex validation on each input
* validate form on clicking 'Verify' button 
* display message at bottom indicating 'Form is Incomplete' or 'Form is Complete'
* communicate form validity between components
* pass unit tests

## Extras
* track form validity live on input change
* display individual field validation error messages below each input
* don't show validation errors until user has touched an input (onBlur) or clicked Verify
* use input name attributes for validation keys, so it's easy to add new fields and validation rules and/or extract form fields to another component

## Further opportunities:
* Use a library like [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) instead of rolling your own over and over
